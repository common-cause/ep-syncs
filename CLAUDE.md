# EP Syncs

Sync scripts connecting Protect the Vote (PTV) shift scheduling and Airtable to BigQuery for election protection volunteer data.

## Project Type
bigquery

## Connections & External APIs

**All external API connections use `ccef-connections`.** Do not write your own BigQuery,
Airtable, or PTV clients directly in this project.

The shared library lives at:
```
C:/Users/RobKerth/OneDrive - Common Cause Education Fund/Documents/AI Interpretation/ccef-connections
```
Install it with:
```bash
pip install -e "C:/Users/RobKerth/OneDrive - Common Cause Education Fund/Documents/AI Interpretation/ccef-connections"
```

**If a PTV API wrapper or Airtable client doesn't exist in `ccef-connections` yet:**
Spec it out and build it *in `ccef-connections`*, then import it here.
Do not duplicate connection logic in individual projects.

## Credential Pattern
All credentials follow `{CREDENTIAL_NAME}_PASSWORD` in `.env` (Civis-compatible).
JSON credentials are stored as unquoted JSON strings. Never commit `.env`.

Active credentials in `.env`:
- `BIGQUERY_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD` — seeded (GCP: `proj-tmc-mem-com`, SA: `com-dbt@`)
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY_PASSWORD` — fill in your Airtable personal access token
- `PTV_API_KEY_PASSWORD` — fill in once credential type is confirmed from sample script
